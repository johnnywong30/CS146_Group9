# Final Deliverable
- At least one form (8 points each for each unique input (not including reset/submit buttons)) up to 24 points
- At least one event listener; 26 points
- Dynamically manipulate DOM; 25 points
- Form Data Validation; 25 points

## What I need to Do
- [ ] JavaScript to validate inputs before submission (can do half of the Ajax)
- [ ] JavaScript to add new form inputs for each different social media (should delegate...)
- [ ] JavaScript to remove a form input (should delegate...)
- [x] JavaScript to remove flashed messages after 3 seconds
- [ ] Flask/Jinja to retrieve potential friends
- [ ] Database methods to edit profile when needed
- [x] Figure out how to store socials -> Delimit each by semi-colon and commas, (Platform,Handle;Platform,Handle;...)
