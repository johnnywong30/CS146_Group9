- Problem: You're off campus and need to get to school quickly.
  Solution: App will tell you the best routes & buses between you and school.

- Problem: Having so many accounts (Slack, email, groupme, etc.) that filtering them all into your memory becomes a hassle.
  Solution: An app that puts all of your work mail into a single account, allowing students & faculty to maintain separation between their work & personal lives
